        "3. **`sum()`**: This calculates the total sum of a column or a series of numbers, proving essential for quick calculations and aggregations in data analysis.\n",

        "4. **`isnull()`**: This helps identify missing or null values in your dataset, allowing for effective data cleaning and preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
